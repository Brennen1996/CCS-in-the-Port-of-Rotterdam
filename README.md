# CCS-in-the-Port-of-Rotterdam
Agent Based Model about the feasibility of embracing "Carbon Capture and Storage" in the Port of Rotterdam

This project is part of the SEN1211 Agent Based Modeling course taught by Dr. ir. Igor Nikolic.

## How-To
The repo exists of 3 parts:
- Model

Next to the agent based simulation model (.nlogo) itself, multiple input files can be found in this folder.
The model uses these input files, next to policy levers and internal relations between variables to create values for the Key Performance Indicators of the system.
 
- Data

This is data generated by the Netlogo model, which mostly exists of the key performance indicators that show the success or failure of the implementation of CCS in the Port of Rotterdam. The .ipynb file makes sense out of the multiple data sets created.

- Report

The report combines our way of working throughout the proces of modeling and analysis and concludes upon the findings of the data analysis. Moreover, the assumptions, modeling choices, recommendations and limitations can be found here.
